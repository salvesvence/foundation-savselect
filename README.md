#### CDN

To start working with Slick right away, there's a couple of CDN choices availabile
to serve the files as close, and fast as possible to your users:

- https://cdnjs.com/libraries/...

#####Example using cdnjs

Just add a link to the css file in your `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//cdnjs.com/libraries/..."/>
```

Then, before your closing ```<body>``` tag add:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.com/libraries/..."></script>
```

#### Package Managers

```sh
# Bower
bower install --save ...

# NPM
npm install ...
```
